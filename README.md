# Scraper universitaly.it

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How does it work

The script will scrape the website [universitaly.it](https://www.universitaly.it/) and save in pickle format all the raw json data. Then it will parse the data into the json format that I use on my website.
